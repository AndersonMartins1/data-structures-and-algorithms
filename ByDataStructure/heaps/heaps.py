#a heap data structure is a complete binary tree that 
#satisfies the heap property, where any given node is either:

#always smaller than the child node/s and the key of the root 
#node is the smallest among all other nodes. aka min heap property

#or

#always greater than its child node/s and the key of the root 
#node is the largest among all other nodes. aka max heap property
